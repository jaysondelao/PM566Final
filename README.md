PM566 Final- Heart disease analysis

Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States. The goal of this analysis is to find out which health indicators are associated heart disease and which indicators will potentially be useful in predicting whether or not someone develop heart disease.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and it is a subset of data from the 2015 CDC's telephone survey across the 50 states. Health indicators and heart disease status were compared to see if there was any association and if people with certain health indicators were more like or less likely to develop heart disease.
