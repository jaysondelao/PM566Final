Which variables will be useful in a prediction model for heart disease.\nAccording to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. We will use a Kaggle dataset of health indicators and heart disease status of more than 200,000 individual across the US.\nOur health indicators consist of known risk factors for heart disease as well as potential risk factors. We will see if our analysis confirms the association of the risk factors in our data.\nTake a look at the data! The first 100 of 253,680 individual’s health factors as well as heart disease status can be viewed through the interactive table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nUnivariate analysis of the health indicator (below) show us the distribution of individuals with each health indicator.\nNotice we can also see the amount of people who have heart disease or a heart attack and those who do not. There are many more people who do not have heart disease than those who do, so we want to keep that in mind when we interpret the each plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we will focus on just a few of the variables: BMI, Age, and Alcohol use. If you are interested in the analysis, download the report at the top of the page to see how these health indicators compared to others.\nHere we can see that on average Individuals who have heart disease are also more likely to have a higher BMI than those who do not. This is an indication that BMI might be a helpful predictor for heart disease.\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

This finding in contrary to what we would expect and suggests that heavy alcohol use may contribute to a decrease in heart disease. Although, this is an interesting finding, the sample size for individuals who use alcohol heavily is quite small compared to the sample size for those who do not use alcohol heavily, so we should keep this in consideration when interpreting our results.\nConclusion: An unhealthy lifestyle contributes greatly to the odds of developing heart disease. BMI and age seemed like the best indicators of developing heart disease from the list of health indicators we studied. Although, heavily alcohol use seemed to decrease the odds of developing heart disease, we should be aware of the possibility of confounding due to the small sample size and continue to study the effects of heavy alcohol use on heart disease."

    "text": "Which health indicator have a greater association with heart disease?\nINTRODUCTION: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States. The goal of this analysis is to find out which health indicators are associated heart disease and will potentially be useful in predicting whether or not someone develop heart disease. Our dataset is a subset of data collected from the CDC’s 2015-Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a telephone survey used to collect data on the health and condition of the residents of the United States of America. The data contains the binary outcome of heart disease or heart attack status along with different health indicators that could be useful in predicting heart disease, such as BMI, smoking status, and age. Most of the health indicator variables have binary responses to a health status or condition, with BMI being the quantitative variable in the data.\nMETHODS: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and it is a subset of data from the 2015 CDC’s telephone survey across the 50 states. The dataset used only includes health indicators that might be useful for predicting heart disease status across the nation. The dataset was downloaded and read in as a CSV file and the dimensions, header, and footer were all checked to ensure the data was properly displaying. The str function was used to look at the structure of the data and see that all of variables are numerical values. The summary function allows us to take a closer look at the variables and see the summary statistics of each variable and any missing values that might occur in the data. No missing values are observed and most variable are binary-categorical variables. All numerical-categorical variables are transformed using ifelse statements to their corresponding category using the Kaggle legend to make the responses more intuitive. The clean dataset was then restricted to variables that would seem to have an association including the new character variables and BMI(duplicates were removed). Exploratory data analysis was run on variables of interest and it is noted that BMI has a max of 98. A BMI of 98 seems to be a suspicious value because most BMI charts only list 30 and above as the highest BMI category. Using medical journals, I was able to verify that BMI values can exceed 100, but the majority of people do not fall into that category. Additionally, I calculated the proportion of individuals that had a BMI greater than 40 in our dataset was 4% and those greater than 50 was 0.8%, so it seems to be reasonable that these BMI values are not errors and will be included in our analysis. Exploratory graphs were created for variables of interest using ggplot and summary tables were created using summarize and kable function.\nDimensions of dataset: 253680 x 22 Header/Footer data is displaying correctly All variable types are numerical. Summary function tells us dataset is well-maintained; no missing values, but BMI max is 98,which is questionable.\nExploratory Analysis\nBMI values greater than 40 seem suspicious, but have been externally validated to exist only 4% of our dataset has BMI greater than 40 and only 0.8% are greater than 50.\nTaking a look at the distribution of our variables.\nThese plots shows the distributions of the variables showing the range of the different responses in each variable.\nData Visualization\nThe histogram, violin plot, and boxplot show how BMI is distributed between Heart disease status. The mean BMI for individuals with heart disease is higher than those without, showing there is a possible association. The scatterplot shows us that the sample size for heart disease status group is not the same so results maybe be skewed. The mean and sample size for each group is show in the table below, which confirms my conclusion.\n\n################\nBMIC2&lt;- ggplot(pred, aes(x = HDorAttack, y = BMI,fill=HDorAttack)) +\n  geom_violin()+\n  labs(x=\"Heart Disease Status\",y=\"BMI\",title=\"Violin map of BMI by Heart Disease Status\")\n\n\nBMIC3&lt;- ggplot(pred, aes(x=HDorAttack,y=BMI,fill=HDorAttack))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  labs(x=\"Heart Disease Status\",y=\"BMI\",title=\"Boxplot of BMI by Heart Disease Status\") + \n  facet_wrap(~carb, ncol = 3) \n\n\n\n\nTable 1:Summary Statistics\n\n\nHDorAttack\nn\nBMI_mean\n\n\n\n\nNo\n229787\n28.26962\n\n\nYes\n23893\n29.46662\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe barplot show how Age is distributed between Heart disease status.

For the most part all the variables that seem to put you in a healthier category showed a decrease in heart disease. Although, the data did seem to have an exception were we show that an increase in heavy use of alcohol showed a decrease in heart diease, but this trend need more research because the data might have been skewed due to small sample size in the heavy use alcohol category. All variables seemed to be associated with heart disease and deserve to be furthered studied, but from the list of variables of interest heavy use of alcohol and fruit eating status seemed to be the least associated between the variables."
